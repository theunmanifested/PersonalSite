    <p>My name is Walter Valdez Santos. I am a First-Generation American. I became a United States Citizen in 2006. In 2007 I joined the United States Army and served honorably for six years. I was born in Northern Mexico in a town called Ciudad Acu√±a. It has great history, awesome people, and is also famous because the they filmed From Dusk til Dawn, El Mariachi, and Desperado in that area. I later studied in Monterrey, and then settled in Del Rio, TX from 2000 until 2007 when I was shipped off for Basic Training at Fort Jackson, SC, then my first duty station at Fort Lee, VA. Then Camp Humphreys, South Korea. Finally, Fort Sam Houston in the San Antonio TX area. I got my Bachelor of Science in Business in December 2015.
