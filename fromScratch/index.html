          <h3>My Early Years Story</h3>
          <p>I was born and raised in Northern Mexico, literally on the border, so there was always the American culture near me. I used to watch regular Saturday mornings cartoons, and we would visit the US basically every week. I went to a private catholic school where there was a big emphasis on English and Computer skills.</p>
          <p>But it was my dad that started my coding journey back in the late 80's. He insisted that I would go into an after-school ... school. It was a small room with about 30 PC with those old bulky monitors that looked like they would break your foot if they ever toppled over. We had floppy, yes, floopy discs, and I remember learning about MSDOS. First thing's first, we started to learn the usual commands like "dir", "cd", "cls", etc. Then the instructor proceeded to blast through a rigorous curriculum that I honestly don't remember too well.</p>
          <p>My first instance of real coding was with a cousin of mine that had, I believe, a Compaq computer and he was running some sort of program that would basially generate computer graphics or digital art. There was a rather sizeable manual with what looked to be gibberish, and my cousin would just copy that "gibberish" by typing, and after hoping he didn't make a single data entry mistake, he would show me that cool digital picture. I was really impressed by this because it felt like someone actually created something.</p>
          <p>Fast forward to me being 15, and now living in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, MX in what is the US equivalent of High School. This particular school was very advanced, and in 1995 had a brand new shiny row of Macs (probably Mac LCs) in one computer lab, and two more rooms of shiny new PCs. I had never seen a Mac, so I jumped right into it, and basically just played around with it (not sure if it was MacPaint, but something similar), and on the PC I probably just used them for regular school work, except for ICQ which blew my mind because I was literally talking with New Zealanders for free!</p>
          <p>I kept being intrigued by the internet, and the massive amounts of new technologies (I remember email and FTP making a big impression on me), but pursued different interests at that point in my life. In 2001, after waiting for five years, I received my Legal Residency, and decided to go to college in Texas. Fast forward again to 2006, and after waiting another five years, I got my US Citizenship. I joined the US Army the next year, and that is definitely another story.</p>
