I made a mistake when it came to the portfolio section and I did not notice until someone pointed it out. Please be sure to READ this so that you can correct the issue.


in the portfolio section of the CSS I had 


.profile-img {
    width: 50rem;
    flex: 1;
}


Please replace that with


.portfolio-img {
    flex: 1;
}


And also add flex: 1 to the .portfolio-description which I left empty


.portfolio-description {
    flex: 1;
}
