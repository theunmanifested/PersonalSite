<p>I am a first-generation American, father of two wonder children, and tinkerer by nature. I honorably served in the United States Army, 
                    and I profoundly believe in volunteering in our communities. I was borned and raised in Ciudad Acu&#241;a, Coahuila, M&#233;xico, which is famous for its wonderful 
                    people, proud history, and where director Robert Rodriguez filmed <a class="in-Text-a" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104815/" target="_blank">El Mariachi</a>, 
                    <a class="in-Text-a" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112851/" target="_blank">Desperado</a>, and 
                    <a class="in-Text-a" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116367/" target="_blank">From Dusk Till Dawn</a>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Currently, I am a student of the Cybersecurity Administration cohort in the <a class="in-Text-a" href="https://military.microsoft.com/programs/mssa/">Microsoft Software &#38; Systems Academy (MSSA)</a>.

                <p>I am currently seeking gainful employment where I would love to put my technincal expertise to work for a forward-thinking, culturally diverse, and ground-breaking company. 
                    For the greater part of my life, I've always delved into Computer Systems, Information Technology, Cybersecurity, Programming, and most things "tech". 
                    I've been fortunate to have been professionally exposed to wide spectrum of leadership-styles, geo-diverse working environments, and culturally-rich variety of teammates. I look forward to
                    the next chapter in my life, and to embrace new opportunities.
