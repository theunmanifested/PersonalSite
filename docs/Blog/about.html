			    <h2 class="title mb-3">About Me</h2>
			    <p>I'm a first-generation American, and originally from Ciudad Acu&ntilde;a in northern Mexico, which is not very well-known except for director Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi, Desperado, and From Dusk Till Dawn films being filmed on site. I learned English at a very young age by memorizing almost all of The Beatles lyrics, and practiced it at least weekly when we visited family members in neighboring Del Rio, TX. In 2001, I received my Legal Residency, and in 2006 I was finally naturalized as an American Citizen.</p>
          <p>Swiftly thereafter, I joined the United States Army as a Petroleum Laboratory Specialist, but I soon became "The Tech Guy" because I was always interested in computers and communications systems. Luckily for me, the Army would quickly place me, and my skills, where most needed. From patching my senior manager's computer software to performing data entry and database management, my role became much more as that of a Technical Services Specialist, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
          <p>I was stationed in Fort Lee, VA were I met my wonderful wife (she was also in the US Army). We had our son Xavier in July 2009 in Prince George county. Our next duty station (assigned military base) took us around the world to South Korea. We were stationed in Camp Humprheys, which is about 40 miles south of South Korea's capital, Seoul. Our new daughter Annabelle was born on Jun 2011. The very next year, we were stationed in San Antonio, TX in Fort Sam Houston, which is where I was medically retired on April of 2013. All-in-all I thoroughly loved the military. It allowed us to have wonderful experiences, and to meet some of the most closests of friends.</p>

          <h5 class="mt-5">My Skills, Experiences, and My Resume</h5>
			    <p>I have had quite a lot of different experiences, and acquired many skills along to the way. One of the things that a resume cannot do is give insight into soft skills and personality-compatability. I am culturally diversed, and love to meet and work with new people from all walks of life. Although I am easy-going, I am also very aware of the importance of being not only reliable, but able to produce time-sensitive results that meet or exceed the mark. I am proud of what I build, and love to fully engage in teamwork to achieve an even higher standard. The military also taught me to be respectful, punctual, and to be able to adapt. The year 2020 was definitely a new experience, but I'm happy to have used my time to sharpen my coding skills. Please feel free to download my resume, and to contact me. Let's get to work!</p>

			    <h5 class="mt-5">About This Blog</h5>
          <p>This is my first blog, and although I will try to post regularly. I have always had an inclination towards a bit of creative (or at least technical) writting for quite some time. I am focusing more on the <strong><a href="https://skilldistillery.com/programs/" target="_blank">Skill Distillery's Full Stack Java Bootcamp</a></strong> curriculum, and because I'm about of start this rigorous coding bootcamp, I chose to use <a href="https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/bootstrap-templates/personal/devblog-free-bootstrap-4-blog-template-for-developers/" target="_blank">3rd Wave Media's DevBlog</a>, which is a free Bootstrap 4 template desiged by <a href="http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com" target="_blank">Xiaoying Riley</a>, and with a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0</a> License use.</p>
          <p>Although I would also like to write a blog from scratch in the near future, I opted for this open source tool to mostly focus on learning path, and to place more emphasis on the content of the blog. And like most developers know, just because you choose to use a dev tool, does not mean that you won't spend lots of time customizing your project, while maintaining the terms of the license of course.</p>
