### Develop personal space to highlight skills, projects, and overview

Currently studing at the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy or MSSA in the Cybersecurity Administration cohort at Randolph AFB, TX (San Antonio area). Intensive and well-rounded program aimed to help transitioning active duty members or veterans off the military armed forces.

Also, showcase the use of git version control, and (obviously) GitHub to demonstrate technical ability into different tech fields.
